##.4 Generator Comprehensions

#   Generator Comprehensions are very similar to list comprehensions. One difference between them is that generator comprehensions 
# use circular brackets whereas list comprehensions use square brackets. The major difference between them is that generators donâ€™t 
# allocate memory for the whole list. Instead, they generate each value one by one which is why they are memory efficient.

#Syntax:
#   output_gen = (var for var in input_sequence if condition)

        return even
